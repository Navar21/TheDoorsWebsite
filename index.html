                <p data-aos = "fade-up" data-aos-duration = "3000">The Doors’ arrival on the rock scene in 1967 marked not only 
                the start of a string of hit singles and albums that would become 
                stone classics, but also of something much bigger – a new and deeper 
                relationship between creators and audience. Refusing to be mere 
                entertainers, the Los Angeles quartet relentlessly challenged, 
                confronted and inspired their fans, leaping headfirst into the heart 
                of darkness while other bands warbled about peace and love. Though they’ve 
                had scores of imitators, there’s never been another band quite like them. 
                And 50 years after their debut album, The Doors’ music and legacy are more 
                influential than ever before.

                    In the middle of 1965, after graduating with a bachelor's degree from 
                    the UCLA film school, Morrison led a bohemian lifestyle in Venice Beach. 
                    Living on the rooftop of a building inhabited by his UCLA classmate, 
                    Dennis Jakob, he wrote the lyrics of many of the early songs the Doors 
                    would later perform live and record on albums, such as "Moonlight Drive" 
                    and "Hello, I Love You". According to fellow UCLA student Ray Manzarek, 
                    he lived on canned beans and LSD for several months.

                <p data-aos = "fade-up" data-aos-duration = "3000">
                    Although Morrison's early education was routinely disrupted as he moved 
                    from school to school, he was drawn to the study of literature, poetry, 
                    religion, philosophy and psychology, among other fields. Biographers 
                    have consistently pointed to a number of writers and philosophers who 
                    influenced his thinking and, perhaps, his behavior. While still in his 
                    adolescence, Morrison discovered the works of German philosopher Friedrich 
                    Nietzsche. Densmore has mentioned that he believed Nietzsche's ideas 
                    of a world with no objective order or structure "killed Jim Morrison".
                </p>
                <p data-aos = "fade-up" data-aos-duration = "3000">
                    Morrison soon emerged as the primary lyricist of the band, though Krieger 
                    wrote or co-wrote several of their hit songs. Morrison typically avoided 
                    using music instruments in live performances, though he learned to use 
                    both the maracas and the tambourine. In June 1966, the band were the 
                    opening act at the nightclub "Whisky a Go Go" in West Hollywood. During 
                    their performances there, Morrison interacted with the Irish singer Van 
                    Morrison (1945-), and studied aspects of Van's stage persona and stagecraft. 
                    He eventually incorporated several of these aspects into his own stage persona.

                    By early 1969, Morrison had gained weight. He decided to stop wearing leather 
                    pants and concho belts, and to dress casually instead. He also ditched his 
                    typically clean-shaven look, and grew a beard for the first time. On 
                    March 1, 1969, Morrison increased his own reputation for rebellious behavior. 
                    While performing at the Dinner Key Auditorium in Miami, he encouraged the 
                    audience to start a riot and threatened to expose his penis on stage. Within 
                    days, six warrants for his arrest were issued by the Dade County Police department. 
                    One on them on charges of indecent exposure.

                    Due to Morrison's ongoing legal problems, many of the Doors' scheduled concerts 
                    had to be canceled. On September 20, 1970, Morrison was convicted of indecent 
                    exposure and profanity in a jury trial in Miami. In October 30, he was officially 
                    sentenced to imprisonment for 6 months and a fine of 500 dollars. Morrison remained 
                    free on a bond of 50,000 dollars. He commented in a press interview that the American 
                    judicial system favors the wealthy, and that (in his words) "if you have money you 
                    generally don't go to jail".

                    In late-1961, Manzarek briefly enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles 
                    School of Law. Unable to acclimatize to the curriculum, he transferred to the Department 
                    of Motion Pictures, Television and Radio as a graduate student before dropping out altogether 
                    after breaking up with a girlfriend. Although he attempted to enlist in the Army Signal Corps 
                    as a camera operator, he was instead assigned to the highly selective Army Security Agency as a 
                    prospective intelligence analyst.

                <p data-aos = "fade-up" data-aos-duration = "3000">
                    The Doors lacked a bass guitarist (except during recording sessions), so for live performances 
                    Manzarek played the bass parts on a Fender Rhodes piano keyboard bass. His signature sound was 
                    that of the Vox Continental combo organ, an instrument used by many other psychedelic rock bands 
                    of the era. He also used a Gibson G-101 Kalamazoo combo organ (which looks like a Farfisa) for the 
                    band's later albums.

                    After recording two solo albums on Mercury Records to a muted reception in 1974, Manzarek played in 
                    several groups, most notably Nite City. He recorded a rock adaptation of Carl Orff's Carmina Burana 
                    (1983; co-produced by Philip Glass), briefly played with Iggy Pop, sat in on one track on the eponymous 
                    1987 album Echo & the Bunnymen, backed San Francisco poet Michael McClure's poetry readings and worked 
                    on improvisational compositions with poet Michael C. Ford. He also worked extensively with Hearts of Fire 
                    screenwriter and former SRC front man Scott Richardson on a series of spoken word and blues recordings entitled 
                    "Tornado Souvenirs". Manzarek produced the first four albums of the seminal punk band X, also contributing 
                    occasionally on keyboards. Two of those have been also included on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

                    In the mid-1960s Densmore joined guitarist Robby Krieger in a band called the Psychedelic Rangers; shortly 
                    thereafter he began rehearsals with keyboardist Ray Manzarek, Manzarek's two brothers and Jim Morrison in the 
                    group Rick & the Ravens. On the brothers' departure from the band, Densmore recommended Krieger join them, 
                    thus forming the Doors in 1965.

                <p data-aos = "fade-up" data-aos-duration = "3000">
                    Densmore formed a musical group with fellow ex-Doors member Krieger in 1973 called the Butts Band. The group 
                    released two albums with two different lineups, and disbanded in 1975. Densmore left rock and roll in the 1980s,
                    moving to the world of dance as he performed with Bess Snyder and Co., touring the United States for two years.

                    “The drum was the first fucking instrument,” declares John Densmore. “The reason people move and dance is that 
                    they’re trying to get back to that heartbeat. It’s the heartbeat you hear in the womb that started the whole deal. 
                    An orchestra, a four-piece rock band, whatever it is, they’re trying to get back to that heartbeat.”
                    The rhythmic engine of The Doors and the man responsible for some of the most famous beats in rock & roll history 
                    has been obsessed with the universal, ancient call of this heartbeat has since his childhood in Southern California.

                    After graduating from high school, Krieger attended the University of California, Santa Barbara. His musical development 
                    included listening to guitarists Wes Montgomery, Albert King, and Larry Carlton who influenced his style. Krieger's 
                    flamenco guitar playing can be heard in the song "Spanish Caravan".

                    Krieger became a member of the Doors in 1965, joining keyboard player Ray Manzarek, drummer John Densmore and vocalist 
                    Jim Morrison, after Manzarek's brothers left the group. At an early Doors rehearsal Morrison heard Krieger playing bottleneck 
                    guitar and initially wanted the technique featured on every song on the first album. Krieger's fingerstyle approach to 
                    the electric guitar, broad musical tastes, and songwriting helped establish the Doors as a successful rock band in the 1960s. 
                    Together with Densmore, he studied under Indian sitarist Ravi Shankar at the Kinnara School of Music in Los Angeles.

                    Most people know Robby Krieger as the consummate music artist in his role as former guitar player and songwriter of the legendary 
                    band The Doors. What shouldn’t be surprising is that creativity has no boundaries and many times artistic expression will spill 
                    over into more then one medium for the artist. Robby Krieger is no exception as demonstrated in his creation of a collection of
