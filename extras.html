                        LOS ANGELES — The door to the Doors is numbered 420. 
                        A quirk of circumstance that feels comically ordained.
                        <br>
                        Technically, this is the entrance to the Doors Music Co., 
                        the licensed legal corporation in a fourth-floor suite of 
                        a flavorless glass rectangle in West Hollywood. Should you 
                        take 2,000 steps east, you’ll find yourself at the

                        Doors reigned a half-century ago as they became the sinistral 
                        emissaries of sex and death at the center of the Summer of Love.

                    In 1949, young Jim Morrison and his family are traveling on 
                    a desert highway in New Mexico where they encounter an auto
                    wreck and see an elderly Native American dying by the roadside. 
                    In 1965, Jim arrives in California and is assimilated into the
                    Venice Beach culture.
                </p>
                <p data-aos = "fade-up" data-aos-duration = "3000">
                    During his tenure studying at UCLA, he
                    meets Pamela Courson and they fall in love, becoming a couple. 
                    He also meets Ray Manzarek for the first time, as well as Robby 
                    Krieger and John Densmore, who form the Doors with Morrison.
                    Jim convinces his bandmates to travel to Death Valley and experience 
                    the effects of psychedelic drugs.

                    Returning to Los Angeles, they play several shows at the famous Whisky a 
                    Go Go nightclub and develop a rabid fanbase. Jim's onstage antics and lewd 
                    performance of the group's song "The End" upset the club's owners, and 
                    the band is ejected from the venue. After the show, they are approached by 
                    producer Paul A. Rothchild and Jac Holzman of Elektra Records and are offered 
                    a deal to record their first album. The Doors are soon invited to perform on 
                    The Ed Sullivan Show, only to be told by one of the producers that they must 
                    change the lyric "girl we couldn't get much higher" in the song "Light My Fire", 
                    due to a reference to drugs. 
                </p>
                <p data-aos = "fade-up" data-aos-duration = "3000">
                    Despite this, Morrison performs the original lyric during 
                    the live broadcast and the band is not allowed to perform on the show again.
                    As the Doors' success continues, Jim becomes increasingly infatuated with his own 
                    image as "The Lizard King" and develops an addiction to alcohol and drugs. Jim becomes 
                    intimate with rock journalist Patricia Kennealy, who involves him in her witchcraft 
                    activities, participating in a mystical handfasting ceremony. Meanwhile, an elder spirit 
                    watches these events.
                </p>
                <p data-aos = "fade-up" data-aos-duration = "3000">
                    The rest of the band grows weary of Jim's missed recording sessions and absences at concerts. 
                    Jim arrives late and intoxicated to a Miami, Florida concert, becoming increasingly confrontational
                    towards the audience and threatening to expose himself onstage. The incident is a low point for the 
                    band, resulting in criminal charges against Jim, cancellations of shows, breakdowns in Jim's personal 
                    relationships, and resentment from the other band members.
